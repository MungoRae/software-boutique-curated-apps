    "description": "A desktop application for managing virtual machines through <code>libvirt</code>. It primarily targets KVM VMs, but also manages Xen and LXC (linux containers). It presents a summary view of running domains, their live performance and resource utilization statistics. Wizards enable the creation of new domains, and configuration and adjustment of a domain's resource allocation and virtual hardware. An embedded VNC and SPICE client viewer presents a full graphical console to the guest domain. ",
