    "description": "Creates a special folder on your computer that you can add remotely hosted folders (or \"projects\") to this folder. These projects will be automatically kept in sync with both the host and all of your peers when someone adds, removes or edits a file. SparkleShare uses the version control system Git under the hood, so setting up a host yourself is relatively easy. SparkleShare was made to cover certain use cases, but does not handle every scenario well. SparkleShare is good for frequently changing project files like text, office documents, and images, tracking and syncing files edited by multiple people, reverting a file to any point in its history. SpakleShare is not good for full computer backups, storing your photo or music collection, or large binary files that change often, like video editing projects. ",
